# Automated-Phishing-Email-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

## Goals of Project

Developed a phishing detection system leveraging machine learning to identify malicious emails and enhance email security.

Engineered cybersecurity-specific features, including URL analysis, domain reputation, and header anomalies, to detect phishing attempts.

Applied threat intelligence techniques to analyze email metadata, sender behavior, and social engineering patterns.

Evaluated detection accuracy using cybersecurity metrics, optimizing for minimal false positives and enhanced threat mitigation.

Applied supervised learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forests) to classify phishing attempts with high accuracy.
